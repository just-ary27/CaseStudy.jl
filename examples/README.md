# Examples
A few examples on how to use the models have been put forward in the form of their notebooks in this section. A brief summary of the examples is given below:

### [Reduced order model for a lithium ion cell with uniform reaction rate approximation](senthil_example.ipynb)
Cell voltage is calculated for a given time-series of current. Two cases are presented, first is for a constant current and the second one is for discrete current time series. The first case also shows plots of various internal parameters that are calculated intermediately.
