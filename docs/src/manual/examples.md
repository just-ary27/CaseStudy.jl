# Examples
You can quickly get started with the library by looking at few examples. These are given as in jupyter notebooks for easier explanation. You can get the same results by running julia scripts. However, if you wish to implement your code in a notebook too, check the [IJulia package.](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)

!!! tip

    We suggest that you read through the respective
    [References](https://github.com/justary27/LiionBatteryModels.jl/tree/main/references) for the
    model you are going to use for a better understanding of what you're doing.
