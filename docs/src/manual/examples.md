# Examples
You can quickly get started with the library by looking at few examples. These are given as in jupyter notebooks for easier explanation. You can get the same results by running julia scripts. However, if you wish to implement your code in a notebook too, check the [IJulia package.](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)

To get a brief overview of what is being done in the notebooks [click here.](https://github.com/just-ary27/CaseStudy/blob/main/examples/README.md)
